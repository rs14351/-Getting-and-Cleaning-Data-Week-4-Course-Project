Overview

My name is Rosane Schossler and this is the evaluation activity of week 4 of the module Getting and Cleaning Data from Coursera, in the Data Science course.

The main objective of creating this repository is to share the activities related to the end of week 4.

To perform this task, some steps were followed:
   
    *  Repository creation
    *  Creation of the R Script file called 'run_analysis.R'
    *  Download and unzip the data provided to work directory R
    *  Download the R source code 
    *  Run the R source code to generate an organized data file

Main Goals

    * Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
    * Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
    * Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
    * Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names.
    * Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject
    
Packages
